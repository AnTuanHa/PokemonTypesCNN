# PokemonTypesCNN

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies Pokemon types based on Pokemon images.

We use the datasets provided from Kaggle:
* [7,000 Labeled Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030/pokemonclassification)
* [Pokemon Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types)

We modified the `pokemon.csv` file from `Pokemon Image Dataset` so that it includes the `Alalon
Sandslash` Pokemon, as well as renamed the row `mr-mime` to `mrmime`.
